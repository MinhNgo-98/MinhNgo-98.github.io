           Hi, my name is Minh Ngo. 
           <br>
           I'm 23 years old and recently graduated with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science & Media at the University of Applied Sciences Dresden (HTW Dresden). My goal is to become a skilled Full Stack web developer who is able to put any of his ideas into practice.
           <br>
           I'm a hungry and hard-working learner and I'm excited to have a look into the professional world of web development.
            So feel free to contact me about anything, if you are interested or have any questions.
